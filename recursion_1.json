        "### Key Features of the Script:",
        
        "1. **Fibonacci Sequence:**",
        "   - The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers.",
        
        "2. **Iterative Calculation:**",
        "   - Instead of using recursion, the script uses a loop to calculate the sequence iteratively.",
        "   - This approach avoids excessive memory usage or stack overflow issues.",
        
        "3. **Logic Flow:**",
        "   - For the first Fibonacci number (`n = 1`), it returns 0.",
        "   - For the second Fibonacci number (`n = 2`), it returns 1.",
        "   - For `n > 2`, the script calculates the sequence by summing the last two numbers until the Nth number is reached.",
        
        "4. **Output:**",
        "   - The function returns the Nth Fibonacci number as specified by the input.",
        
        "### Complexity Analysis:",
        
        "**Time Complexity:**",
        "- The function iterates through the sequence using a single loop.",
        "- Since the loop runs `n-2` times, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.",
        
        "**Space Complexity:**",
        "- The function only uses two integer variables (`prev` and `curr`).",
        "- Since no additional lists or recursive calls are used, the space complexity is **O(1)**."

        "### Key Features of the Product Sum Script:",
        "1. **Recursive Approach:**",
        "   - The function `productSum()` uses recursion to handle nested arrays. When an element is a list, the function calls itself with an incremented depth.",
        "2. **Depth Multiplier:**",
        "   - For every level of nesting, the sum of elements is multiplied by the current depth. This adds weight to elements that are deeper in the array structure.",
        "3. **Handling Mixed Structures:**",
        "   - The function can handle arrays with a mix of integers and nested arrays, processing them seamlessly.",
        "### How It Works:",
        "1. The script initializes the `result` to 0 and iterates over the elements of the input array.",
        "2. If an element is a list, the function recursively calculates its product sum with an incremented depth.",
        "3. If an element is an integer, it is added directly to the `result`.",
        "4. After iterating through the array, the cumulative sum is multiplied by the current depth and returned."
