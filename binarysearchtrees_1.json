        "1. **Binary Search Tree Properties:**",
        "   - Each node in a BST has a value and two child nodes: `left` and `right`.",
        "   - The left child node contains values smaller than the parent node.",
        "   - The right child node contains values greater than the parent node.",
        "",
        "2. **Logic for Finding the Closest Value:**",
        "   - The function starts at the root node and initializes the `closest` variable to infinity.",
        "   - It traverses the tree while updating the closest value if the current node's value is nearer to the target.",
        "   - Depending on whether the target is smaller or larger than the current node's value, it moves to the left or right subtree, respectively.",

        "**Time Complexity:**",
        "- In the average and best cases (balanced BST), the time complexity is **O(log n)**, as each step reduces the search space by half.",
        "- In the worst case (unbalanced BST, resembling a linked list), the time complexity is **O(n)** because the function may traverse the entire tree.",
        "",
        "**Space Complexity:**",
        "- The space complexity for this iterative solution is **O(1)** because only a few variables (e.g., `closest`, `currentNode`) are used.",
        "- In a recursive approach, the space complexity would be **O(h)**, where `h` is the height of the tree (up to **O(n)** in the worst case)."

    "- Adds a new value to the BST while maintaining the binary search property.",
    "- Traverses the tree from the root, placing the new value in the appropriate position based on comparisons.",

    "2. **Search Method (`contains`)**",
    "- Checks whether a given value exists in the BST.",
    "- Starts at the root and follows the left or right child depending on whether the target value is smaller or larger.",

    "3. **Remove Method (`remove`)**",
    "- Removes a node from the BST while preserving the structure.",
    "- Handles three cases: node with two children, one child, or no children.",
    "- For a node with two children, it replaces the node's value with the smallest value from its right subtree (in-order successor).",
    "- For root deletions with one child, it adjusts the root node to simulate in-place removal.",

    "**Time Complexity (Worst Case):**",
    "- If the BST becomes unbalanced (e.g., resembles a linked list), operations degrade to O(n)",

    "**Space Complexity:**",
    "- O(1) auxiliary space for iterative methods, O(h) stack space for recursive removal where h is tree height."
