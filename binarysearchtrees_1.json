        "### Key Features of the Closest Value in BST Function:",
        "1. **Binary Search Tree Properties:**",
        "   - Each node in a BST has a value and two child nodes: `left` and `right`.",
        "   - The left child node contains values smaller than the parent node.",
        "   - The right child node contains values greater than the parent node.",
        "",
        "2. **Logic for Finding the Closest Value:**",
        "   - The function starts at the root node and initializes the `closest` variable to infinity.",
        "   - It traverses the tree while updating the closest value if the current node's value is nearer to the target.",
        "   - Depending on whether the target is smaller or larger than the current node's value, it moves to the left or right subtree, respectively.",

    "2. **Search Method (`contains`)**",
    "- Checks whether a given value exists in the BST.",
    "- Starts at the root and follows the left or right child depending on whether the target value is smaller or larger.",

    "3. **Remove Method (`remove`)**",
    "- Removes a node from the BST while preserving the structure.",
    "- Handles three cases: node with two children, one child, or no children.",
    "- For a node with two children, it replaces the node's value with the smallest value from its right subtree (in-order successor).",

    "### How the Function Works:",
    "1. **What Makes a Tree a Valid BST?**",
    "- In a valid BST, every node must satisfy two conditions:",
    "  - All values in the left subtree are strictly less than the node’s value.",
    "  - All values in the right subtree are greater than or equal to the node’s value.",
    "- These rules must hold recursively for every node in the tree.",
    
    "2. **Recursive Validation with Min/Max Constraints:**",
    "- A helper function `validateBstHelper()` is used to traverse the tree recursively.",
    "- It ensures that each node’s value lies within a valid range defined by `minValue` and `maxValue`.",
    "- The left child is checked with an updated upper bound, and the right child with an updated lower bound.",
    
    "3. **Why This Approach is Reliable:**",
    "- Unlike an in-order traversal check, this method directly validates BST rules at each node.",
    "- It immediately detects violations deep in the tree structure, even if the overall order appears correct.",
    
    "### Complexity Analysis:",
    "**Time Complexity:** O(n) — Each node is visited once.",
    "**Space Complexity:**",
    "- O(log n) for a balanced tree due to recursion depth.",
    "- O(n) in the worst case (e.g., a skewed tree)."
