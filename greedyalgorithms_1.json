        "1. **Sorting for Optimization:**",
        "   - The function begins by sorting the query durations in ascending order. This ensures that shorter queries are processed first, minimizing the waiting time for longer queries.",
        "",
        "2. **Logic for Calculating Waiting Time:**",
        "   - A cumulative sum (`cumulative_duration`) is maintained to keep track of the total duration of queries that have been processed so far.",
        "   - For each query, the cumulative duration is added to the total waiting time before being updated with the current query's duration.",
        "",
        "3. **Output:**",
        "   - The function returns the minimum total waiting time for all queries.",

        "**Time Complexity:**",
        "- The function sorts the query list, which takes **O(n log n)** time due to Timsort.",
        "- After sorting, the function iterates through the list once, requiring **O(n)** time.",
        "- Since sorting dominates, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**.",
        "",
        "**Space Complexity:**",
        "- The sorting is done in-place, requiring no additional space beyond the input list.",
        "- Only a few integer variables (`total_waiting_time`, `cumulative_duration`) are used, resulting in constant **O(1)** space usage.",
        "- Therefore, the overall space complexity is **O(1)**."

        "### Key Features of the Tandem Bicycle Script:",
        "1. **Input and Sorting:**",
        "   - The function takes two lists of cyclist speeds, `redShirtSpeeds` and `blueShirtSpeeds`, and a boolean `fastest` to determine whether the goal is to maximize or minimize total speed.",
        "   - Both speed lists are sorted in ascending order. If `fastest` is `True`, the `blueShirtSpeeds` list is reversed into descending order to pair the fastest cyclist with the slowest one for maximum speed.",
        "2. **Pairing Cyclists:**",
        "   - The script iterates through the sorted lists, pairing cyclists from `redShirtSpeeds` and `blueShirtSpeeds`.",
        "   - For each pair, the higher speed is selected to maximize the total speed of the tandem bicycle.",
        "3. **Output:**",
        "   - The function returns the total speed of the paired cyclists based on the pairing strategy determined by the `fastest` parameter."
