            "2. For each number in the array, the difference between the target sum and the current number is calculated.",
            "3. If this difference exists in the dictionary `seen`, it means the pair of numbers that sum to the target has been found, and the function returns them.",
            "4. If the difference is not found, the current number is added to the dictionary for future reference.",
            "5. If no pair is found after iterating through the array, an empty list is returned."

        "### Explanation of the Code:",
        "1. **Function Purpose:**",
        "   - The function `isValidSubsequence()` takes two arguments: an array and a sequence.",
        "   - It returns `True` if the sequence is a valid subsequence of the array, otherwise it returns `False`.",
        "2. **How It Works:**",
        "   - The function iterates through the array and tries to match elements with the sequence. It keeps track of the position in the sequence with the variable `seqidx`.",
        "   - Each time an element in the array matches the current element in the sequence, `seqidx` is incremented to check the next element in the sequence.",
        "   - If the entire sequence is matched by the end of the array, the function returns `True`.",
        "   - If the sequence is not completely matched or the array is exhausted, it returns `False`.",
        "3. **Edge Case:**",
        "   - The function ensures that the sequence is not empty and the full sequence is present in the array before returning `True`."

        "### Key Features of the Tournament Winner Script:",
        "1. **Input Processing:**",
        "   - Accepts a list of competitions, where each element contains two competing teams.",
        "   - Accepts a results list that indicates the winner of each match. A value of `1` means the home team won, while `0` means the away team won.",
        "2. **Points Calculation:**",
        "   - Iterates through all matches, awarding 3 points to the winner of each competition.",
        "   - Stores the points in a dictionary where the key is the team name, and the value is the total score.",
        "3. **Determine the Winner:**",
        "   - Identifies the team(s) with the highest total points after all competitions.",
        "   - Handles tie situations by returning all teams with the highest score as co-winners.",
        "### How It Works:",
        "1. For each match in the `competitions` list, the script determines the winner based on the corresponding value in the `results` list.",
        "2. Points are added to the winning team's total in the `points` dictionary.",
        "3. After all matches, the script identifies the team(s) with the maximum score.",
        "4. If one team has the highest score, it declares them as the winner. If there is a tie, it declares multiple winners.",
        "### Benefits:",
        "- Efficiently calculates the tournament winner even with large datasets.",
        "- Handles tie-breaking scenarios gracefully.",
        "- Provides clear and concise output with the winner or co-winners of the tournament."
