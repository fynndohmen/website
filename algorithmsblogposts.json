            "2. For each number in the array, the difference between the target sum and the current number is calculated.",
            "3. If this difference exists in the dictionary `seen`, it means the pair of numbers that sum to the target has been found, and the function returns them.",
            "4. If the difference is not found, the current number is added to the dictionary for future reference.",
            "5. If no pair is found after iterating through the array, an empty list is returned."

        "### Explanation of the Code:",
        "1. **Function Purpose:**",
        "   - The function `isValidSubsequence()` takes two arguments: an array and a sequence.",
        "   - It returns `True` if the sequence is a valid subsequence of the array, otherwise it returns `False`.",
        "2. **How It Works:**",
        "   - The function iterates through the array and tries to match elements with the sequence. It keeps track of the position in the sequence with the variable `seqidx`.",
        "   - Each time an element in the array matches the current element in the sequence, `seqidx` is incremented to check the next element in the sequence.",
        "   - If the entire sequence is matched by the end of the array, the function returns `True`.",
        "   - If the sequence is not completely matched or the array is exhausted, it returns `False`.",
        "3. **Edge Case:**",
        "   - The function ensures that the sequence is not empty and the full sequence is present in the array before returning `True`."
