            "1. A dictionary called `seen` is initialized to store numbers that have been processed.",
            "2. For each number in the array, the difference between the target sum and the current number is calculated.",
            "3. If this difference exists in the dictionary `seen`, it means the pair of numbers that sum to the target has been found, and the function returns them.",
            "4. If the difference is not found, the current number is added to the dictionary for future reference.",
            "5. If no pair is found after iterating through the array, an empty list is returned."
