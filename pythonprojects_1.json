            "This Python script implements a simple yet functional Tic-Tac-Toe game. Two players can play the game alternately on a 3x3 board. The program handles user inputs, checks for a winner, and declares a draw when no more moves are possible."

            "### Key Features of the Code:",
            "1. **Board Display:** The `display` function creates a formatted string to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board and prints it for players after every move.",
            "2. **Winner Check:** The `check_winner` function checks rows, columns, and diagonals for a winning condition and ends the game if a player wins. It also declares a draw if no spaces are left.",
            "3. **Player Moves:** The `play` function ensures that players can only place their marks on empty spaces, prompting them to try again if the field is already occupied.",
            "4. **Game Loop:** The `while True` loop alternates between the two players, allowing them to make moves, updates the board, and checks for game-ending conditions.",
            "### How It Works:",
            "- The board is initialized as a 3x3 grid filled with `.` to indicate empty spaces.",
            "- Players take turns entering their moves as coordinates (e.g., `0 1` for row 0 and column 1).",
            "- After each move, the board is displayed, and the program checks if the move led to a win or a draw.",
            "- The game ends when one player wins or all spaces are occupied.",
            "### Example Use:",
            "1. Start the game, and the empty board is displayed:",
            "   ```",
            "   ...",
            "   ...",
            "   ...",
            "   ```",
            "2. Player `O` makes the first move: `0 0`",
            "   ```",
            "   O..",
            "   ...",
            "   ...",
            "   ```",
            "3. Players alternate turns until the game ends with a win or a draw."

        "2. **Task Management:** Users can add new tasks, view open tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.",
        "3. **Separation of Logic:** The application is divided into multiple modules: `views.py` handles the GUI, `controllers.py` manages the control logic, and `models.py` handles the data and storage logic.",
        "4. **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are stored in a JSON file (`database.json`), ensuring that tasks persist across sessions.",
        "",
        "### How the Code Works:",
        "1. **Starting the Application:** The application begins by loading existing tasks from `database.json` using the `load_from_storage` function in `models.py`.",
        "2. **Adding a Task:** When the user enters a task and clicks the 'Add task' button, the `add_task` function in `views.py` calls `handle_add_task` from `controllers.py`, which updates the task list and saves it to the JSON file.",
        "3. **Marking a Task as Completed:** The user can select a task from the open tasks list and click 'Mark as completed'. This triggers the `mark_task_completed` function, which updates the task's status and moves it to the completed tasks list.",
        "4. **Deleting a Task:** The user can delete tasks from either the open or completed lists by selecting the task and clicking 'Delete task'. This action removes the task from the list and updates the JSON file.",

        "- **app/controllers.py:** Contains the control logic that connects the GUI with the data layer.",
