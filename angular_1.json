"A personal project to learn Angular the practical way: I built a Habit Tracker with a clean dark UI, offline storage, and on-device notifications. Below I walk through what the app does, a few design decisions, and the little engineering bits that made it stable on Android (Capacitor) without needing any backend."

"### Core features (what you can do)",
"- **Create habits** with a name, **period** (Day / Week / Month) and **repetitions per period**.",
"- **Add reminders** directly when creating a habit or later in Settings: pick a time and select weekdays (defaults to all days if you don’t choose).",
"- **Edit reminders** at any time; the app cancels old schedules and creates new ones to avoid duplicates.",
"- **Track progress**: see *current* and *longest streaks* plus a compact streak timeline for each habit.",
"- **Stay private**: everything is stored locally on your device; there’s no login and no data leaves your phone.",
"",
"---",
"### Screens at a glance",
"- **Habits list** *(first screenshot)* — compact cards show your progress and streak counters. The floating **+** opens the add dialog.",
"- **New habit** *(second screenshot)* — choose period & repetitions; tap **Add notification** to attach reminders before saving.",
"- **Add reminder modal** *(third screenshot)* — a simple time wheel and weekday chips (Mo–Su). If you don’t select days, the reminder runs every day.",
"- **Settings** *(fourth screenshot)* — per-habit details: current/longest streaks, timeline, quick actions (manage reminders, reset period, delete).",
"",
"---",
"### Tech stack",
"- **Ionic + Angular (standalone components)** for the UI and routing.",
"- **Capacitor** for native bridges, especially **Local Notifications** on Android.",
"- **Offline-first storage** via Capacitor Preferences/Storage; no server required.",
"- **Dark theme** by default; high-contrast accents for category colors.",
"",
"---",
"### Notifications: what matters on Android 13+",
"- Android 13+ requires a **runtime permission** for posting notifications. The app asks **only when you add/save reminders**, not on the first launch.",
"- To keep the app stable, all plugin calls are wrapped in `try/catch`, and scheduling only runs **after** permission is granted.",
"- Reminders are scheduled per habit and weekday. When you edit reminders, the app **cancels** the old ones first, then **reschedules** the new set.",
"",
"---",
"### Little engineering details",
"- **Crash-proof plugin usage**: permission checks & scheduling are isolated in a `NotificationService` so UI code stays simple and safe.",
"- **Deterministic IDs** for reminders (per habit, per time, per day) prevent duplicates.",
"- **Default-sane UX**: if you add a reminder time but pick no weekdays, the app assumes *every day*.",
"- **No background surprise**: reminders exist only because you created them; the app doesn’t auto-add or reschedule behind your back.",
"",
"---",
"### What I learned",
"- Start with a tiny vertical slice (one habit, one reminder), then harden the edges (permissions, cancel/reschedule).",
"- Capacitor is great for *just-enough native* without leaving the Angular mindset.",
"- Stability on Android is mostly about **when** you call native APIs and **what happens when they fail** — handle both deliberately.",
"",
"---",
"### Roadmap",
"- Optional iOS build & minor UI polish for larger screens.",
"- Export/backup of local data.",
"- Gentle onboarding & tips for first-time users.",
"",
"---",
"### Try it",
"The app is currently distributed via Google Play test tracks for quick feedback. If you’re on the tester list, use the opt-in link to install from the Play Store and you’ll get updates automatically."

  "title": "Building My Own Flashcards PWA: A Minimal, Difficulty-Driven Anki Alternative",
  "content": [
    "I wanted the spaced repetition feel of Anki but with absolute control over which difficulty levels I review at any given moment. So I built a small, dark-themed flashcards Progressive Web App (PWA) with Angular that runs on my Mac and iPad, works offline, and stores everything locally.",
    "The app is organized around decks, a clean split between edit mode and practice mode, and a 1–10 difficulty scale. After each card, I rate how hard it felt; later, I can start a session that targets exactly one difficulty band—or all cards that are still unsorted.",
    "Under the hood, the app is intentionally simple: a single state service backed by localStorage, JSON export/import for backups and cross-device sync, and a few UI components that keep screenshots front and center so I can study from full-screen code images."

    "3. On device B I use `Import data` and pick that JSON file.",

    "2. **Rate difficulties as I go**",

    "",
    "4. **Occasional backup**",
    "   - Every once in a while I export a backup from my Mac and import it on the iPad.",

    "",
    "---",
    "### Takeaways",
    "",
    "- You don’t always need a massive spaced-repetition engine. For some workflows, **manual difficulty control** plus filtering is enough—and actually more intuitive.",
    "- A tiny domain model (`Deck`, `Flashcard`, `CardSideContent`, `DifficultyLevel`) is powerful when combined with a good UI.",
    "- PWAs + GitHub Pages are underrated for personal tools: I get a cross-platform app with offline support without touching any backend.",
    "- Multiple screenshots per card side turned out to be crucial for studying algorithms and code; the UI now treats images as first-class citizens, not just a decoration.",
    "",
    "Most importantly, this app is small and *mine*: I understand every part of it, can tweak it whenever I feel like it, and it fits perfectly into how I learn."
