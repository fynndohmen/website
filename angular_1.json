"title": "Habit Tracker — a tiny, offline-first Ionic/Angular app with smart reminders",
"content": [
"A personal project to learn Angular the practical way: I built a Habit Tracker with a clean dark UI, offline storage, and on-device notifications. Below I walk through what the app does, a few design decisions, and the little engineering bits that made it stable on Android (Capacitor) without needing any backend."

"### Core features (what you can do)",
"- **Create habits** with a name, **period** (Day / Week / Month) and **repetitions per period**.",
"- **Add reminders** directly when creating a habit or later in Settings: pick a time and select weekdays (defaults to all days if you don’t choose).",
"- **Edit reminders** at any time; the app cancels old schedules and creates new ones to avoid duplicates.",
"- **Track progress**: see *current* and *longest streaks* plus a compact streak timeline for each habit.",
"- **Stay private**: everything is stored locally on your device; there’s no login and no data leaves your phone.",
"",
"---",
"### Screens at a glance",
"- **Habits list** *(first screenshot)* — compact cards show your progress and streak counters. The floating **+** opens the add dialog.",
"- **New habit** *(second screenshot)* — choose period & repetitions; tap **Add notification** to attach reminders before saving.",
"- **Add reminder modal** *(third screenshot)* — a simple time wheel and weekday chips (Mo–Su). If you don’t select days, the reminder runs every day.",
"- **Settings** *(fourth screenshot)* — per-habit details: current/longest streaks, timeline, quick actions (manage reminders, reset period, delete).",
"",
"---",
"### Tech stack",
"- **Ionic + Angular (standalone components)** for the UI and routing.",
"- **Capacitor** for native bridges, especially **Local Notifications** on Android.",
"- **Offline-first storage** via Capacitor Preferences/Storage; no server required.",
"- **Dark theme** by default; high-contrast accents for category colors.",
"",
"---",
"### Notifications: what matters on Android 13+",
"- Android 13+ requires a **runtime permission** for posting notifications. The app asks **only when you add/save reminders**, not on the first launch.",
"- To keep the app stable, all plugin calls are wrapped in `try/catch`, and scheduling only runs **after** permission is granted.",
"- Reminders are scheduled per habit and weekday. When you edit reminders, the app **cancels** the old ones first, then **reschedules** the new set.",
"",
"---",
"### Little engineering details",
"- **Crash-proof plugin usage**: permission checks & scheduling are isolated in a `NotificationService` so UI code stays simple and safe.",
"- **Deterministic IDs** for reminders (per habit, per time, per day) prevent duplicates.",
"- **Default-sane UX**: if you add a reminder time but pick no weekdays, the app assumes *every day*.",
"- **No background surprise**: reminders exist only because you created them; the app doesn’t auto-add or reschedule behind your back.",
"",
"---",
"### What I learned",
"- Start with a tiny vertical slice (one habit, one reminder), then harden the edges (permissions, cancel/reschedule).",
"- Capacitor is great for *just-enough native* without leaving the Angular mindset.",
"- Stability on Android is mostly about **when** you call native APIs and **what happens when they fail** — handle both deliberately.",
"",
"---",
"### Roadmap",
"- Optional iOS build & minor UI polish for larger screens.",
"- Export/backup of local data.",
"- Gentle onboarding & tips for first-time users.",
"",
"---",
"### Try it",
"The app is currently distributed via Google Play test tracks for quick feedback. If you’re on the tester list, use the opt-in link to install from the Play Store and you’ll get updates automatically."
