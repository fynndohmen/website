        "### How the Caesar Cipher Works:",
        "1. **Letter Shifting:**",
        "   - Each letter in the string is shifted forward by a given key value.",
        "   - If the end of the alphabet is reached, the shifting continues from the beginning (e.g., 'z' with a shift of 2 becomes 'b').",
        "2. **Modulo Operation:**",
        "   - To keep shifts within the bounds of the alphabet, the function uses modulo `26`.",
        "3. **ASCII Manipulation:**",
        "   - The function converts each character into its ASCII code using `ord()`, modifies it, and converts it back using `chr()`. This ensures an efficient transformation."

        "### How Run-Length Encoding Works:",

        "2. **Processing the String:**",
        "   - The function iterates through the string, counting consecutive identical characters.",
        "   - If the sequence exceeds 9 characters, it is split into multiple segments since a single digit is used to represent the count.",
        "3. **Output Format:** The compressed string consists of alternating numbers and characters representing the character count and the character itself."

        "   - It then iterates through the `document` string, checking if each character is available in sufficient quantity.",
        "3. **Handling Character Shortages:**",
        "   - If a required character is missing or insufficient, the function immediately returns `False`.",
        "4. **Reducing Character Counts:**",
        "   - If a character is found in the `characters` string, its count is reduced to reflect that it has been used.",
        "5. **Final Result:**",
        "   - If all characters in the document can be matched with available characters, the function returns `True`."
