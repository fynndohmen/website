        "2. A while loop runs as long as `leftIdx` is less than `rightIdx`.",
        "3. In each iteration, the characters at `leftIdx` and `rightIdx` are compared.",
        "   - If they are different, the function returns `False`, meaning the string is not a palindrome.",

        "1. **Letter Shifting:**",
        "   - Each letter in the string is shifted forward by a given key value.",

        "     ```",
        "     23 + 2 = 25",
