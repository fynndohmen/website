        "1. **Letter Shifting:**",
        "   - Each letter in the string is shifted forward by a given key value.",
        "   - If the end of the alphabet is reached, the shifting continues from the beginning (e.g., 'z' with a shift of 2 becomes 'b').",
        "2. **Modulo Operation:**",
        "   - To keep shifts within the bounds of the alphabet, the function uses modulo `26`.",
        "3. **ASCII Manipulation:**",
        "   - The function converts each character into its ASCII code using `ord()`, modifies it, and converts it back using `chr()`. This ensures an efficient transformation."
